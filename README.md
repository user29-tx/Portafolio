# Portafolio
Hi, my name is Arturo Garcia, I'm a self-taught pentester and passionate about technology.
Here you can see some of the thing's i've working on, but mostly writeups of the machines, challenges, and fortress I complete from Hackthebox.

I'm currently studying college and for CCNA1 Cisco certificate, and with plans on getting an Offsec certification.

I'm also starting to learn IA and machine learning but still developing the projects, so you'll have to wait to see them.

As you can see I'm a quick and self-taught learner and if you want to collaborate DM me to the next email:)
