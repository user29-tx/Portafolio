Hello mate!

First of all an important finding regarding our website: Login is prone to SQL injection! Ask the developers to fix it asap!

Regarding your training material, I added the two binaries for the remote exploitation training in exploitme.zip. The password is the same we use to encrypt our communications.
Make sure those binaries are kept safe!

To make your life easier I have already spawned instances of the vulnerable binaries listening on our server.

The ports are 5555 and 7777.
Have fun and keep it safe!
